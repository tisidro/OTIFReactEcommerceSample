Assessment for OTIF--taking FIGMA template for Home page of ecommerce site and recreating it in React.

The site work I did consists of an App.jsx component and a StoreCard.jsx component. The site has several 'cards' on the home page. This is not a functional site, only to demonstrate my ability to closely model a Figma template provided using CSS in React.

Next steps would be to implement the search function, make the Connect and Disconnect buttons functional, and link content to the Choose a Store and other interactive items.
